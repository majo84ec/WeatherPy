# WeatherPy

##  Overview:

The Beta testers of PlanMyTrip app have recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.
For this challenge, we will use the weather description data we've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, we'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, we will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
